    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h5>Pie Crust:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups plus 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup shortening</li>
            <li>6 to 8 tbsp. ice cold water</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Filling:</h5> 
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
            <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp. lemon zest</li>
            
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour and salt. Cut in shortening until evenly dispersed.</li>
            <li>Add cold water and mix. Dough should cling together and clear sides of bowl.</li>
            <li>Separate into two balls, cover and put in the fridge while you prepare the filling.</li>
            <li>Stir the blueberries, sugar, flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a large bowl. Mix until it is no longer dry and powdery.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place baking sheet on bottom oven rack to catch any blueberry juices.</li>
            <li>Roll out the chilled pie dough. Fold in half and then half again and carefully transfer to pie plate. Unfold and center.</li>
            <li>Pour filling into pie.</li>
            <li>Roll out the second ball of dough. Cut into strips to make a lattice.</li>
            <li>Assemble the lattice on top of the filling. Place strips vertically until pie is covered. Weave in horizontal strips by going under and over the vertical strips.</li>
            <li>Bake the pie at 425 degrees for 25 mins., then reduce temperature to 375 degrees. Place tin foil around the edges of the pie to prevent over-browning. Bake for another 40-50 mins.</li>
            <li>Remove pie from oven, and cool before serving.</li>
        </ol>
