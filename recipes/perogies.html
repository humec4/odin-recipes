        Description
    </h4>
    <p>Perogies taste much better when made from scratch. These Polish perogies use sour cream in the dough for added flavour. Make a big batch and throw them in the freezer for quick and delicious meals down the road. Enjoy!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h5>Dough:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>2 cups sour cream</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. melted butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Filling:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>8 baking potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir flour and salt together in large bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk sour cream, eggs, egg yolk, butter and oil together in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir wet ingredients into dry until well blended. Cover bowl with a towel and let stand 15-20 mins.</li>
            <li>Place potatoes into a pot and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cool until tender, about 15 mins.</li>
            <li>Drain water from potatoes and mash with shredded cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Separate perogie dough into two balls. Roll out one ball at a time on lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Cut into circles using a cookie cutter or glass, 3 to 4 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Assemble perogies. Brush a little water around the edges of the circle and spoon some filling into the center.</li>
            <li>Fold the circle in half and press to seal the edges (or use a fork for crimped edges).</li>
            <li>Place perogies on a cookie sheet and freeze. Once frozen transfer to freezer bags.</li>
            <li>To cook your pierogies you can boil or fry them. Place perogies in boiling water and boil until they float to the top. Or fry on medium-low heat until they are no longer frozen in the center.</li>
        </ol>
